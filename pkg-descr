This port contains a script for generating portaudit reports for jails running on a FreeBSD system.

Jailaudit runs in the Host-system and uses portaudit to create reports for every jail currently running.

It can also be used to send specific report-mails to the owner of a jail by running it as a cronjob.

/etc/crontab example: 
0   4   *   *   *   *   root   /usr/local/bin/jailaudit mail admin@foo.bar "foo.example.com bar.example.com"

Sends reports-mails of the jails with the hostnames foo.example.com and bar.example.com to the mailaddr. admin@example.com.
